### Ensuring Causality
By default MDE assess every observation vector to be added as a manifold
dimension with the [Convergent Cross Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_cross_mapping) ([CCM](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/496))causality test. This can be disabled with the ```noCCM``` option. 

Here we review essential aspects of CCM.
